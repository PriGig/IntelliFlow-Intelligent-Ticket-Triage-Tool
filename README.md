ðŸ§  Project Story
Every enterprise support team struggles with thousands of incoming tickets daily â€” prioritizing and solving them efficiently is a challenge.
I built IntelliFlow during a Microsoft Hackathon to solve this. Itâ€™s a smart assistant powered by Azure OpenAI that triages support tickets by auto-summarizing, categorizing, and suggesting resolutions, drastically cutting investigation time.
What started as a weekend idea turned into a hackathon-winning prototype that caught the attention of PMs and support leads across the org.
